Welcome to the documentation of the CMS Particle Flow Algorithm. <br> 
The aim of this page is to provide a centralized overview of the CMS Particle Flow algorithm with the main focus being on:

* [Core Particle Flow algorithm](page2.md)
* [Particle Flow Block algorithm](pfblock.md)

## What is Particle Flow?

The Particle Flow (PF) algorithm is used to reconstruct and identify individually all particles produced in CMS by combining information from all subdetectors.<br>
These particles include:<br>

* [Muons](page2.md#muons)
* [Electrons](page2.md#electrons)
* [Photons](page2.md#photons)
* [Charged hadrons](page2.md#charged-hadrons)
* [Neutral hadrons](page2.md#neutral-hadrons)

## How do particles traverse through the CMS detector?
